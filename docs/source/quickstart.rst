Qickstart Guide
===============

This section aims to get you started within a few couple of minutes, while still explaining what is going on, so that someone with only limited experience with Python can follow along.

**Setup TL;DR**

.. tabs::

    .. tab:: POSIX (Linux, BSD, OSX, etc)

        .. code-block:: console

            docker run --name redis_gears --rm -d -p 127.0.0.1:6379:6379 redislabs/redisgears:1.0.6

            virtualenv -p python3.7 .venv
            source .venv/bin/activate

            pip install redgrease[all]

.. _quick_running_gears_server:

Running Redis Gears
-------------------

The easiest way to run a Redis Engine with Redis Gears is by running one of the offical Docker images, so firstly make sure that you have `Docker engine <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/>`_ installed.

(Eh? I've been living under a rock. `What the hedge is Docker? <https://docker-curriculum.com/>`_) 

With Docker is installed, open a terminal or command prompt and enter:

.. code-block:: console

    docker run --name redis_gears --rm -d -p 127.0.0.1:6379:6379 redislabs/redisgears:1.0.6

This will run a single Redis engine, with the Redis Gears module loaded, inside a Docker container.
The first time you issue the command it may take a little time to lauch, as Docker needs to fetch the container image from `Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com/r/redislabs/redisgears>`_.


Lets break the command down:

- ``docker run`` is the base command telling Docker that we want to run a new containerized process.
- ``--name redis_gears`` gives the name "redis_gears" to the container for easier identification. You can change it for whatever you like or omit it to assign a randomized name.
- ``--rm`` instucts Docker that we want the container to be removed, in case it stops. This is optional but makes starting and stopping easer, although the state (and stored data) will be lost between restarts.
- ``-d`` instructs Docker to run the contaioner in the background as a 'daemon'. You can omit this too, but your terminal / command prompt will be hijacked by the output / logs from the container. Which could be interesting enough.
- ``-p 127.0.0.1:6379:6379`` instructs Docker that we want your host computer to locally (127.0.0.1) expose port 6379 and route it to 6379 in the container. This is the default port for Redis communication and this argument is necessary for application on your computer to be able to talk to the Redis engine inside the Docker container.
- ``redislabs/redisgears:1.0.6`` is the name and version of the Docker image that we want to run. This specific image is prepared by RedisLabs and has the Gears module pre-installed and configured.

.. _quick_running_gears_cluster:

.. note:: 

    If its your first time trying Redis Gears, stick to the command above, but if you want to try runing a `cluster image <https://hub.docker.com/r/redislabs/rgcluster>`_ instead, you can issue the following command:

    .. code-block:: console

        docker run --name redis_gears_cluster --rm -d -p 127.0.0.1:3001:30001 -p 127.0.0.1:3002:30002 -p 127.0.0.1:3003:30003 redislabs/rgcluster:1.0.6

    This will run a 3-shard cluster exposed locally on ports 30001-30003.


Refer to the `official documentation <https://docs.redislabs.com/latest/modules/redisgears/installing-redisgears/>`_ for more information and details on how how to install Redis Gears.


Checking Logs:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can confirm that the container is running by inspecting the logs / output of the Redis Gears container by issuing the command:

.. code-block:: console

    docker logs redis_gears

- You can optionally add the argument ``--follow`` to continously follow the log output.

- You can optionally add the argument ``--tail 100`` to start showing the logs from the 100 most recent entries only.

If you just started the single instance engine, the logs should hold 40 odd lines starting and ending something like this:

.. code-block:: console

    1:C 03 Apr 2021 07:41:37.250 # oO0OoO0OoO0Oo Redis is starting oO0OoO0OoO0Oo
    1:C 03 Apr 2021 07:41:37.251 # Redis version=6.0.1, bits=64, commit=00000000, modified=0, pid=1, just started
    ... 
    ... 
    ...
    1:M 03 Apr 2021 07:41:37.309 * Module 'rg' loaded from /var/opt/redislabs/lib/modules/redisgears.so
    1:M 03 Apr 2021 07:41:37.309 * Ready to accept connections


Stopping
~~~~~~~~
You can stop the container by issuing:

.. code-block:: console

    docker stop redis_gears

If successful, it should simply output the name of the stopped container: ``redis_gears``


.. _quick_installation:

RedGrease Installation
----------------------

For the client application environment, it is strongly recommended that you set up a virtual Python environment, with `Python 3.7 <https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-379/>`_ specifically.


.. note:: 

    The Redis Gears containers above use Python 3.7 for executing Gear functions, and using the same version the client application will enable more features.


.. warning::

    The RedGrease client package works with any Python version from 3.6 and later, but :ref:`execution of dynamically created GearFunction objects <exe_gear_function_obj>` is only possible when the client Python version match the Pyhon version on the Redis Gears server runtime.

    If the versions mismatch, Gear function execution is limited to :ref:`execution by string <exe_gear_function_str>` or :ref:`execution of script files <exe_gear_function_file>`

With Python 3.7, and `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io>`_ installed on your system:


#. Create a virtual python3.7 environment

    .. code-block:: console

        virtualenv -p python3.7 .venv

    Python packages, including RedGrease that you install within this virtual environment will not interfere with the rest of your system.

#. Activate the environment 

    .. tabs::

        .. tab:: POSIX (Linux, BSD, OSX, etc)

            .. code-block:: console

                source .venv/bin/activate

        .. tab:: The Windows

            .. code-block:: console

                .venv\Scripts\activate.bat

        
#. Install redgrease

    .. code-block:: console

        pip install redgrease[all]

    .. note:: 

        The ``[all]`` portion is important, as it will include all the Redgrease extras, and include the dependencies for the RedisGears client module as well as the RedGrease Command Line Intreface (CLI).

        See :ref:`here <adv_extras>` for more details on the various extras options.


.. _quick_examples:
.. _quick_basics:

Basic Commands
--------------

In this section we'll walk through some of the basic commands and interactions with the RedGrease Gears client, including executing some very basic Gear functions.

The next chapter ":ref:`client`", goes into all commands in more details, but for now we'll just look at the most important things.

You can take a sneak-peek at the full code thtat we will walk through in this section, by expanding the block below (click "â–¶ Show").

If you find this rather selfself-explanatory, then you can probably jump directly to the next section where we do some  :ref:`quick_example_gears_comparisons` with "vanilla" RedisGears functions.

Otherwise just contiue reading and we'll, go through it step-by-step.

.. container:: toggle

    .. container:: header

        Full code of this section.

    .. literalinclude::  ../../examples/basics.py
        :caption: From examples/basics.py on the official `GitHub repo <https://github.com/lyngon/redgrease>`_:
        :linenos:

|br|
Let's look at some code examples of how to use RedGrease, warming up with the basics.

Instantiation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Naturally, the first thing is to import of the RedgGrease package and :ref:`instantiate Redis Gears client / connection object <client_gears_instantiation>`:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/basics.py
    :end-before: # Normal Redis Commands
    :caption: Package import and client / connection instantiation:
    :lineno-match:

This will attempt to connect to a Redis server using the default port (6379) on "localhost", which, if you followed the instructions above should be exactly what you set up and have running. There are of course arguments to set other targets, but more on that later.

The imported ``add`` function from the ``operator`` module is not part of the RedgGrease package, but we will use it later in one of the examples.

.. note:: 

    If you created :ref:`a Redis cluster <quick_running_gears_cluster>` above then you have to specify the initial master nodes you want to connect to:

    .. code-block:: python
        :linenos:

        import redgrease

        r = redgrease.RedisGears(port=30001)


Redis Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The instantiated client / connection, ``r``, accepts all the normal Redis commands, exactly as expected. 
The subsequent lines populate the Redis instance it with some data.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/basics.py
    :start-after: # Normal Redis Commands
    :end-before: # Redis Gears Commands
    :caption: Some normal Redis commands:
    :lineno-match:


Gears Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The client / connection also has a ``gears`` attribute that gives access to :ref:`client_gears_commands`.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/basics.py
    :language: python
    :lineno-match:
    :start-after: # Redis Gears Commands
    :end-before: # GearFunctions
    :caption: Some Redis Gears commands:    
    :emphasize-lines: 2,6,10,14,21-22

The highligthed lines show the commands :meth:`.Gears.pystats`, :meth:`.Gears.dumpregistrations` and :meth:`.Gears.pyexecute` respectively and the output sould look something like this:

.. code-block:: console
    
    Gears Python runtime stats: PyStats(TotalAllocated=41275404, PeakAllocated=11867779, CurrAllocated=11786368)
    Registered Gear functions: []
    Result of nothing: True
    All-records gear results: [
        b"{'event': None, 'key': 'Baz-fighter', 'type': 'string', 'value': '-747'}"
        b"{'event': None, 'key': 'Bar-fighter', 'type': 'string', 'value': '63'}"
        b"{'event': None, 'key': 'transactions:0', 'type': 'unknown', 'value': None}"
        b"{'event': None, 'key': 'Foo-fighter', 'type': 'string', 'value': '2021'}"
        b"{'event': None, 'key': 'noodle', 'type': 'hash', 'value': {'meaning': '42', 'spam': 'eggs'}}"
    ]
    Total number of keys: 5

The command :meth:`.Gears.pystats` gets some memory usage statistics about the Redis Gears Python runtime environment on the server.

The command :meth:`.Gears.dumpregistrations` gets information about any registered Gears functions, in this cas none.

And finally, the commmand :meth:`.Gears.pyexecute` is the most important command, which sends a Gears function to the server for execution or registration.
In the above example, we are invoking it three times:

- Firstly (line 35) - We pass nothing, i.e. no function at all, which naturally doesn't do anything, but is perfectly valid, and the call thus just returns ``True``.

- Secondly (line 39) - We execute a :ref:`exe_gear_function_str`, that reads through the Redis keys (indicated by the ``'KeysReader'``) and just returns the result by running the function as a batch job (indicated by the ``run()`` operation). The result is consequently a list of dicts, representing the keys and their respective values and types in the Redis keyspace, I.e. the keys we added just before.

- Thirdly (lines 46-47) - We pass a very similar function, but with an additional ``count()`` operation, which is a Gear operation that simply aggregates and counts the incoming records, in this case all key-space records on the server. The result is simply the number or keys in the database: ``5``.

There are other Gears commands too, and the next chapter, ":ref:`Redgrease Client <client>`", will run through all of them.

GearFunctions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Composing Gear functions by using strings is not at all very practical, so RedGrease provides a more convenient way of constructing Gear funtctions programmatically, using various :ref:`gearfun` objects. 


.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/basics.py
    :start-after: # GearFunctions
    :end-before: Simple Aggregation 
    :caption: GearFunction objects instead of strings:
    :lineno-match:
    :emphasize-lines: 2

This Gear function does the same thing as the last function of the previous example, but instead of being composed by a string, it is composed programatically using RedGrease's GearFunction objects, in this case using the :class:`KeysReader <.KeysReader>` class.

The output is, just as expected:

.. code-block:: console

    Total number of keys: 5

.. warning:: 
    Note that execution of GearFunction objects only work if your local Python environment version matches the version on the Redis Gear server, i.e. Python 3.7.

    If the versions mismatch, Gear function execution is limited to :ref:`execution by string <exe_gear_function_str>` or :ref:`execution of script files <exe_gear_function_file>`

The final basic example shows a GearFunction that has a couple of operations stringed together.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/basics.py
    :start-after: Simple Aggregation 
    :caption: Simple aggreation - Add keyspace values:
    :lineno-match:

This Gear function adds the values of all the simple keys, with names ending in "-fighter", which were the first three keys created in the example.

And indeed, the result is:

.. code-block:: console

    Sum of '-fighter'-keys values: 1337

Here is a quick run down of how it works: 

- Firstly, the :class:`KeysReader <.KeysReader>` is parameterized with a key pattern ``*-fighter`` meaning it will only read the matching keys.
- Secondly, the :meth:`map() <.OpenGearFunction.map>` operation uses a simple `lambda function <https://realpython.com/python-lambda/>`_, to lift out the ``value`` and ensure it is an integer, on each of the keys.
- Thirdly, the :meth:`aggregate() <.OpenGearFunction.aggregate>` operation is used to add the values together, using the imported ``add`` function, starting from the value 0.
- Lastly, the :meth:`run() <.OpenGearFunction.run>` operation is used to specify that the function should run as a batch job. The ``on`` argument states that we want to run it immediately on our client / connection, ``r``.


The chapter ":ref:`gearfun_readers`" will go through the various types of readers, and the chapter :ref:`operations` will go through the various types of operations, and how to use them.


.. _quick_example_gears_comparisons:

RedgGrease Gear Function Comparisons
------------------------------------

Now let's move on to some more examles of  smaller Gear functions, before we move on to some more elaborate examples.

The examples in this section are basically comparisons of how the examples in the `official Gears documentation <https://oss.redislabs.com/redisgears/master/examples.html>`_, could be simplified by using RedGrease.

.. note::
    RedGrease is backwards compatible with the "vanilla" syntax and structure, and all versions below are still perfectly valid Gear functions when executing using RedGrease.


Word Count
~~~~~~~~~~
Counting of words.

Assumptions
...........
All keys store Redis String values. Each value is a sentence.

Delete by Key Prefix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Deletes all keys whose name begins with a specified prefix and return their count.

Assumptions
...........
There may be keys in the database. Some of these may have names beginning with the "delete_me:" prefix.

Vanilla Version
...............

This is the the `'Delete by Key Prefix' example from the official RedisGears documentation <https://oss.redislabs.com/redisgears/master/examples.html#delete-by-key-prefix>`_.

Keyspace Notification Processing
~~~~~~~~~~
This example demonstrates a two-step process that:

#. Synchronously captures distributed keyspace events
#. Asynchronously processes the events' stream


Assumptions
...........
The example assumes there is a ``process`` function defined, that does the actual processing of the deleted records. For the purpose of the exaple we can assume that it just outputs the name of the expired keys to the Redis logs, as follows:

.. _quick_example_command:

Cache Get Command
---------------

As a final example of this quickstart tutorial, let's look at how we can build caching into Redis as a new command, with the help of Redis Gears and RedGrease.

.. container:: toggle

    .. container:: header

        Full code.

    It may look a bit intimidating at first, but theres actually not not that much to it. 
    Most of it is just comments, logging or testing code. 

    .. literalinclude:: ../../examples/cache_get_command.py
        :caption: Simple Caching command:

|br|

Let's go through the code, step by step, and it will hopefully make some sense.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/cache_get_command.py
    :end-before: CommandReader Decorator
    :caption: Instantiation as usual:
    :lineno-match:

The instantiatoion of the client / connection is busienss as usual.

Cache-Get function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lets now go for the core of the solution; The code that we want to run on Redis for each resource request.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/cache_get_command.py
    :lines: 14-
    :end-before: Test caching on some images
    :caption: Cache handling function:
    :emphasize-lines: 1, 6, 17, 19
    :lineno-match:


Look at the highligthed lines, and notice:

- The logic of handling requests with caching is simply put in a normal function, much like we would if the caching logic was handled by each client.
- The argument of the function is what we could expect, the ``url`` to the resource to get.
- The function return value is either:
    - The contents of the response to requests to the URL (line 32), or
    - A cached value (line 19)

Which is exactly what you would expect from a cached fetching function. 

The really intersting part, however, is this little line, on top of the function. 

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/cache_get_command.py
    :start-after: CommandReader Decorator
    :lines: -10
    :caption: CommandReader function decorator:
    :emphasize-lines: 3
    :lineno-match:

All the Redis Gears magic is hidden in this function decorator, and it does a couple of important things:

- It embeds the function in a :class:`.CommandReader` Gear function.
- It ensures that the function is redgistered on our Redis server(s).
- It captures the relevant requirements, for the function to work.
- It ensures that we only register this function once. 
- It creates a new function, with the same name, which when called, triggers the corresponding registered Gear function, and returns the result from the server.

This means that you can now call the decorated function, just as if it was a local function:

.. code-block:: python

    result = cache_get("http://images.cocodataset.org/train2017/000000169188.jpg")

This may look like it is actually executing the function locally, but the ``cache_get`` function is actually executed on the server.

This means that the registered ``cache_get`` Gear function can not only be triggered by the client that defined the decorated function, but **can be triggered by any client** by invoking the Redis Gear `RG.TRIGGER <https://oss.redislabs.com/redisgears/commands.html#rgtrigger>`_ command with the the functions' trigger name and arguments. 

In our case, using `redis-cli` as an example:

.. code-block:: console

    > RG.TRIGGER cache_get http://images.cocodataset.org/train2017/000000169188.jpg

The arguments for the :func:`@command <redgrease.command>` decorator, are the same as to the :meth:`OpenGearFunction.register` method, inherited by the :class:`CommandReader` class.

.. note:: 

    This simplistic cache function is only for demonstrating the command function decorator. 
    The design choices of this particular caching implementation is far from ideal for all use-cases. 
    
    For example:

    - Only the response content data is returned, not response status or headers. 
    - Cache is never expiring.
    - If multiple requests for the same resource is made in close successions, there may be duplicate external requests.
    - The entire response contents is copied into memory before writing to cache.
    - ... etc ... 

    Naturally, the solution could easily be modified to accomodate other behaviors.


Testing the Cache
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To test the caching, we create a very simple function that iterates through some URLs and tries to get them from the cache and saving the contents to local files.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/cache_get_command.py
    :start-after: Test caching on some images
    :end-before: Clean the database
    :caption: Test function:
    :emphasize-lines: 19
    :lineno-match:

Calling the this function twice reveals that the caching does indeed seem to work.

.. code-block:: console

    Cache-miss time: 10.954 seconds
    Cache-hit time: 0.013 seconds
    That is 818.6 times faster!

We can also inspect the logs of the Redis node to confirm that the cache function was indeed executed on the server.

.. code-block:: console

    docker logs --tail 100

And you should indeed see that the expected log messages appear:
